# Personal-Blog-Web-APIs-

## Web APIs: Week 4 Challenge

## Summary of Task
This week my Challenge was to create a two-page website where users input and view blog posts.

It includes a content form, dynamically rendered blog posts, and a light/dark mode toggle feature. Through the experience, I gained practical JavaScript experience, grew familiar with the Document Object Model, and set the stage for more advanced tasks.  

**Note:** 

I received assistance on the light-dark mode toggle feature with the help of a Tutor. 

I also used styling for some of the colors, text, and navigation-header from a previous project I did for this bootcamp (Professional Portfolio: Week 2 Challenge).

Below are the following Challenge requirements according to the 
**User Story** & **Acceptance Criteria**

## User Story

```md
AS A marketing student,
I WANT a personal blog
SO THAT I can showcase my thoughts and experiences.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a personal blog
WHEN I load the app,
THEN I am presented with the landing page containing a form with labels and inputs for username, blog title, and blog content.
WHEN I submit the form,
THEN blog post data is stored to localStorage.
WHEN the form submits,
THEN I am redirected to the posts page.
WHEN I enter try to submit a form without a username, title, or content,
THEN I am presented with a message that prompts me to complete the form.
WHEN I view the posts page,
THEN I am presented with a header, with a light mode/dark mode toggle, and a "Back" button.
WHEN I click the light mode/dark mode toggle,
THEN the page content's styles update to reflect the selection.
WHEN I click the "Back" button,
THEN I am redirected back to the landing page where I can input more blog entries.
WHEN I view the main content,
THEN I am presented with a list of blog posts that are pulled from localStorage.
WHEN I view localStorage,
THEN I am presented with a JSON array of blog post objects, each including the post author's username, title of the post, and post's content.
WHEN I take a closer look at a single blog entry in the list,
THEN I can see the title, the content, and the author of the post.
WHEN I view the footer,
THEN I am presented with a link to the developer's portfolio.
```
## Getting Started

My file consists of the following structure:

```md
my-blog
├── assets
│   ├── css
│   │   ├── blog.css
│   │   ├── form.css
│   │   └── styles.css
│   └── js

│       ├── form.js
│       └── logic.js
├── index.html
├── blog.html
└── README.md
```

## Deploying to GitHub Pages
Along with the above requirements, I created this project and deployed it to GitHub Pages. This included creating a new repository, cloning it to my computer, and using git commands to save and push my code to the GitHub repository. 

Hope you enjoyed reviewing the Blog!  Go ahead and try it out!
